# Assembly Tests for Amber

To build an assembly test, use `make all TEST=[testname]`, where there exists a file `testname.S` in the tests directory.

Note that any compiled tests need to go into `/home/DRRA/545Project/amber/Amber_25_Vivado/Amber_25/Amber_25/Amber_25.srcs/sources_1/imports/vlog/tests`.
