TEST_PLAN

Here, organized by type/area, are tests that we have for regressions and ones to be written. If you see an area that isn't filled and have time, please do so! Most tests will be .S files using the ARM ISA defined in the amber-core.pdf. Other additions will be marked in documentation (yet to be added). Please familiarize yourself with ARM ISA (along with condition codes, barrel shifting, and core operating modes and register settings) before committing a test.

AREAS:

1. MEMORY INTERFACE

  A. THE L1 CACHE TESTS ARE PRETTY GOOD BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADD ONE FEEL FREE

  B. DRAM/DDR3 INTERFACE TESTS (ONE FOR SIMULATION, ONE FOR THE FPGA LOGIC ANALYZER)


2. INSTRUCTION SET & INSTRUCTION SET ACCESSORIES

  A. ARITHMETIC INSTRUCTIONS (NOT INCLUDING FLOATS, MULT, OR DIV)
    1. ADD AND ADD DERIVATIVES

    2. SUB AND SUB DERIVATIVES

    3. SHIFTS (LEFT, RIGHT ARITHMETIC, RIGHT LOGICAL)

  B. ARITHMETIC INSTRUCTIONS II
    1. INTEGER MULTIPLY AND MULTIPLY DERIVATIVES


  C. BIT-WISE OPERATORS
    1. AND, OR, XOR(?), ...?

  D. FLOW CONTROL (INCLUDES EXPLICIT BRANCHES AND PREDICATED EXECUTION USING CONDITION CODES)
    1. CONDITION CODES USAGE SHOULD BE DONE AFTER CHECKING THAT THEY ARE SET AT ALL/EFFECTIVELY (LETTER F)

    2. BRANCHES, JUMPS

    3. COMPARE FUNCTIONS (THERE ARE QUITE A FEW)

  E. BARREL SHIFTING

  F. CONDITION CODES (SETTING AND CHECKING)
    1. THIS CAN (AND SHOULD) BE COMBINED WITH CORE MODE CHANGES/ISA INSTRUCTIONS TOGETHER
       IN ORDER TO CHECK CODES IN ALL POTIENTIAL SITUATIONS

  G. LOADS AND STORES


3. OUT OF ORDER EXECUTION

  A. REGISTER ALIAS TABLE

  B. RE-ORDER BUFFER

  C. EXECUTION UNIT PIPELINING??


5. CORE MODE CHANGE

  A. USER MODE TO SUPERVISOR MODE AND VICE VERSA

  B. USER MODE TO IRQ AND BACK

  C. USER MODE TO IRQ TO FIQ AND BACK

  D. USER MODE TO SUPERVISOR MODE TO IRQ AND BACK

  E. USER MODE TO SUPERVISOR MODE TO IRQ TO FIQ AND BACK

  F. ABORT MODE TEST

  G. UNDEFINED MODE TEST

  H. AFTER DEFINING THE UNDEFINED MODE, MAKE A NEW TEST FOR THAT (IF WE DEFINE IT)
