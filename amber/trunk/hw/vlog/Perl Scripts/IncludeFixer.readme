IncludeFixer.pl was written because I needed to relativize the paths in `include directives to get ModelSim to simulate it. (I use it because it's free and plays nicely with Linux.) Since ModelSim isn't the official simulator for this project, I haven't actually run this code on the version of amber in the git repository. But it's here in case whatever simulator we're actually using has the same problem.
