Week 11: Thanksgiving


Other tasks:
Sound
VGA
keyboard input
memory subsystem
disk
other I/O

App ideas:
- 1-thread matrix multiply
- Multithread matrix multiply
- Oregon Trail
- Text-based RPGs
- Startup sounds

Goals:
"A++" = working MorphCore running Linux
"A+" = "working" MorphCore but without OS boot (dedicated apps only)
"A" = OOO superscalar running Linux (no MorphCore)
"B" = non-superscalar OOO running Linux
"C" = something kinda-sorta works, maybe, if you jigger it just right...
"D" or "R" = everything is broken, no demo, fire, flood, famine, death, lawsuit, decapitation, missing limbs, ...
