10/5:
1) Linux running on unmodified Amber 25, in synthesis
2) ALU and ISA testing done on unmodified Amber 25
3) OOO design - build full netlist of what hooks up to what in the new design (pre-implementation)
4) Start superscalar planning

10/12:
1) Add new multiplier to Amber 25
2) Memory interface and branching tests
3) Develop OOO verification tests
4) HDMI output basics (no video card design yet)
5) PS/2 input module
6) OOO building: build Dispatch stage, start Execute

10/19:
1) OOO building: finish Execute, build Reorder, integrate with Writeback
2) Whitebox verification of Dispatch/Execute
3) Demo planning: program choices, peripheral testing, stuff to demonstrate OOO improvement over in-order
4) Start video controller development

10/26:
1) Whitebox verification of Reorder and functionality tests of whole OOO core
2) Finish superscalar planning, start Fetch/Decode implementation
3) Finish video controller development

11/2:
1) Superscalar - finish Fetch/Decode implementation, start Dispatch/Reorder/Execute/Writeback
2) Video controller integration with non-superscalar OOO, plus testing/verification
3) MorphCore design (modified, probably splitting into multiple OOO cores with new assembly instruction. instruction also flushes all caches, and the multicore version will have NO cache. :-P)

11/9:
1) Continue video controller testing
2) Superscalar verification - regression testing, and newer specialized tests
3) MorphCore implementation

11/16:
1) MorphCore verification/debugging. Cacheless will help. :-D
2) Demo programs/prep

11/23:
<Thanksgiving, expect nothing to get done>

11/30:
Final report writing, demo prep, more MorphCore if we can

12/7:
Presentation and demo week
